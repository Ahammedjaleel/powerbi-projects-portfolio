# 📊 Sensor Data Analysis Dashboard – Power BI

This Power BI project presents an in-depth analysis of **sensor data** collected from various environmental and motion detectors. It includes measurements such as **CO**, **humidity**, **LPG**, **motion**, **smoke**, and **temperature**.

The dashboard follows a **storytelling approach** to uncover patterns and correlations that can inform safety, automation, and monitoring decisions — applicable in real-world contexts like **smart homes**, **industrial safety**, and **environmental control systems**.

---

## 📌 Overview

- 🛠️ **Built With**: Power BI Desktop
- 📁 **Data Source**: Sensor readings (CO, humidity, LPG, motion, smoke, temperature)
- 🎯 **Goal**: Identify relationships between environmental factors and human activity patterns
- 💡 **Use Cases**: Smart homes, fire risk detection, gas leak monitoring, safety automation

---

## 🔍 Key Insights & Storytelling Findings

### 💨🔥 CO and Smoke Trend Alignment
- CO and smoke levels **rise and fall together**, indicating a strong correlation.
- Suggests a **shared source**, such as **cooking**, **burning**, or **potential fire risk**.
- Monitoring both metrics together can **improve early detection** of hazardous events.

---

### 🚨🕙 Alert Timing Indicates Human-Linked Hazards
- Alerts are only triggered when **motion is detected**, linking hazards to **human activity**.
- **No alerts during inactive periods**, implying the environment is **safe when unoccupied**.
- **Most alerts occur between 7:00 PM and 10:00 PM**, coinciding with **CO and smoke spikes**.

---

### 🛢️❌ No LPG–Smoke Correlation Detected
- No correlation found between **LPG** and **smoke** levels.
- **All LPG readings remain low**, with **no spikes** or unusual activity.
- Suggests **no gas leaks** or LPG-related hazardous events occurred during monitoring.

---

### 😴🔍 Motion Activity Unrelated to Environmental Changes
- **No motion detected** between **4:00 AM and 10:00 AM**; activity is irregular throughout the day.
- No clear relationship between **motion** and environmental factors like **CO**, **smoke**, or **LPG**.
- **Gas and smoke levels remain stable**, showing **minimal environmental impact** from motion.
