## üìò Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **IoT-based environmental sensor data** using **Power BI** to uncover hidden patterns and potential hazards. The dataset includes readings for **CO, smoke, LPG, motion, humidity, temperature**, and more.

The interactive dashboard provides real-time insights into:
- Air quality and gas leak detection
- Human activity-linked alerts
- Time-based environmental trends

Built using Power BI, Azure Data Factory, and Dataflows, this project demonstrates how sensor data can be transformed into meaningful, actionable intelligence for **smart homes**, **fire safety**, and **automated monitoring systems**.
